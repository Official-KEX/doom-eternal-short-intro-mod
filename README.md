## :clipboard: About:<br />
Replaces the loud and 30s long Boot/Startup Video with a 3 Second Clip<br />
<br />
**This will probably only useful for a few people, but:**<br />
Using the "Launch Option Parameter" `+com_skipIntroVideo 1` has the potential to, *for whatever fucking reason*, <br />
break your savegame or make the game not load your profile. Replacing the intro video with a shorter video, <br />
instead of skipping it, seems to fix the problem.At least for me it works. Thats why im sharing it with others.</br>

## :floppy_disk: Download & Installation
:godmode: **Download**: [DOOMEternal_Short_Intro_Mod.zip](https://github.com/Official-KEX/doom-eternal-short-intro-mod/raw/main/DOOMEternal_Short_Intro_Mod.zip) <br />
:suspect: **Installation**: **`Do not install the .zip with ModInjector! Extract it and read the readme.txt inside!`**

---

## :information_source: **Note:**
I have no idea what exactly is triggering the `"Empty Profile"-Bug`, when using `+com_skipIntroVideo 1`. <br />
But if my attempt to skip/shorten the intro video fails too, *you simply have to accept it and watch the original intro.* </br>
